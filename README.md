#Java.zip (The jave codes for MSGC)
The code can be used to test the overall workflow of MSCG

#Matlab.zip (The matlad codes for MASC)
The code can be used to test the workflow of MASC

#ClusteringDatasets (Artificial datasets for clustering)
Several artificial datasets for testing clustering algorithms
